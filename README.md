## About Me

I've been involved with electronic music and creative coding since the 80s. After a break, I returned to my passion, focusing on demoscene-inspired electronic music and developing tools that aid my creative process. I primarily use OpenMPT and FL Studio for music production, and I experiment with VST plugins to refine my sound.

If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to say hello, please feel free to reach out via the contact page. Constructive feedback is always welcome and really helps me grow as an artist.
